## Overview
This repository is intended for students enrolled in the **B.Tech 3rd Semester** program at **Graphic Era Hill University**. It includes a series of exam questions focused on Object-Oriented Programming in C++. These questions cover the essential topics of the C++ OOPs paradigm and are aimed at helping students prepare for their final exam.

## Exam Topics
The exam will cover the following topics:
1. **Introduction to C++**: Basic syntax, data types, operators, and flow control.
2. **Classes and Objects**: Definition, instantiation, constructors, destructors.
3. **Encapsulation**: Access specifiers, data hiding.
4. **Inheritance**: Types of inheritance, access control in inheritance, base class and derived class.
5. **Polymorphism**: Function overloading, operator overloading, virtual functions, runtime polymorphism.
6. **Abstraction**: Abstract classes, pure virtual functions.
7. **Friend Functions**: Definition and usage.
8. **STL (Standard Template Library)**: Vectors, lists, stacks, queues, iterators.
9. **Exception Handling**: try-catch blocks, exceptions in functions.
10. **File Handling in C++**: Reading and writing to files, file stream handling.

## Questions
Here are some sample exam questions that cover the main topics of the course:

1. **Write a C++ program to define a class representing a bank account. Include functions for depositing and withdrawing money, as well as checking the balance.**
   
2. **Explain and demonstrate function overloading in C++ with an example.**
   
3. **Create a C++ program that demonstrates inheritance with at least one base class and two derived classes. Show how to use member functions of the base class in the derived class.**

4. **Write a C++ program to implement polymorphism by overloading an operator to add two objects of a class.**

5. **Create an abstract class in C++ and implement it in a derived class. Explain the use of pure virtual functions.**

6. **Demonstrate the use of exception handling in C++ by writing a program that handles divide-by-zero errors.**

7. **Write a C++ program to open a text file, read its contents, and display them on the screen. Handle any potential errors during file reading.**
